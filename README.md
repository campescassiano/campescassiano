## Hi 👋, 

I am an embedded software engineer 👨‍💻 based in Brazil 🇧🇷. Currently, I am working full-remote on R&D projects for IoT, more specifically in developing embedded systems using the MQTT-SN (MQTT for Sensor Networks) stack, MQTT stack, and other TCP/IP-related protocols for IoT products.

My past experiences range from Network Operating Systems, and Linux kernel development, down to embedded systems development focusing on IoT.

My major interests are embedded systems development - working closely with hardware and software; Linux kernel development; Computer Networks, and flash-based memory devices.

"You want something. Go get it. Period."
